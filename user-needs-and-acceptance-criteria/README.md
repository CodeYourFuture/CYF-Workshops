## Introduction

When designing and building systems, understanding the customer is critically important. If we don't understand the customer, we may build something that solves the wrong problem, or something that the user can't use.

In this workshop, we are going to think about designing a digital system for a pub. We will think about different user personas, their needs, and how we may be able to solve them.

## Identify User Types (5 minutes)

Get in small groups or pairs to brainstorm and list at least 3 different users of a pub system.

<details>

<summary>Expand for some possible users - compare your list to these when you're done</summary>

* Pub Customer (guest)
* Bartender/Waitstaff
* Pub Manager/Owner
* Kitchen Staff
* Supplier/Delivery Person

</details>

## Define User Needs (10 minutes)

For each user type, take 10 mins to discuss and write down their main needs or goals when interacting with the pub's system.

Examples:

| User Type     | Needs / Goals                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer      | Browse menu, place order, reserve table, pay bill, leave review |
| Bartender     | View orders, update order status, manage reservations           |
| Manager/Owner | View sales reports, manage menu, oversee staff schedules        |
| Kitchen Staff | Receive new orders, update order status                         |
| Supplier      | Schedule deliveries, update inventory                           |

</details>

## Write User Stories (10 minutes)

Select at least one user type within your groups and write a user story for them, focusing on a specific need.  

<details>

Format could be as follows:

* "As a _user type_, I want to _do something_, so that _benefit_."

Example could be as follows:

* "As a customer, I want to reserve a table online, so that I can ensure seating when I arrive."

## Acceptance Criteria with Gherkin (15 minutes)

For each user story, write acceptance criteria using [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/).

<details>

Make sure Gherkin syntax is clear for trainees as below:

```
Given [context]
When [action]
Then [expected outcome]
```

Ask trainees to think of examples if theyâ€™re stuck. See below for examples:

* Customer Table Reservation:

```
Given I am a registered customer on the pub's website
When I select a date and time and submit a reservation request
Then I should see a confirmation message with my reservation details
```

* Bartender Viewing Orders:

```
Given I am logged in as a bartender
When a new order is placed by a customer
Then I should see the new order appear at the top of my orders list
```

## Group Sharing & Discussion (10 minutes)

Take {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} to present your user stories and acceptance criteria.

Discuss what makes acceptance criteria clear and testable for {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}}.

<details>

## Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

As a group, summarise the key takeaways and discuss why applying these practices in future projects could be useful.
