# Stand-up [PD 30 minutes]🧍‍♂️

Most software development teams have a "[stand-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting)" every day. Even if a team does not follow the [agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), stand-ups are used to discuss progress and identify blockers.

## Learning Objectives 🙆

```objectives
- Explain the format of a stand-up meeting
- Identify the purpose of a stand-up meeting
- Share a progress update in a stand-up meeting
```

## What is a stand-up meeting?

1. Daily
1. _Short_
1. Focused

Traditional stand-up meetings require everyone to **stand up** so that the meeting is short.

> [!TIP]
> Standup: a focused meeting where all team members disseminate their progress, plans, and problems in a short amount of time.

> [!NOTE]
>
> ### Activity: Prepare your Stand-up (5m)
>
> 1. Set a timer for 5 minutes
> 2. Write down three bullet points:
>
> - 1. What you worked on yesterday
> - 2. What issues are blocking you / What problems you encountered
> - 3. What you will work on today

## Set up 🌼

- Split up into breakout rooms of 5 - 10 people
- Set a timer for 10 minutes

## 🧩 Time to Have a First Stand-up

1. Take turns to describe
   - what you worked on this week,
   - something that is blocking you or that you struggled with (do not discuss solutions yet)
   - and what you plan to work on today. If you need help or want to pair with someone to work on something specific this is a time to communicate that!
1. After everyone has given an update, reflect on next steps together. Is there something that multiple people said they struggled with that you could team up with? Is someone working on something interesting that you want to know more about?
1. Where else can you ask a question and in which slack channels when you have a problem?

> [!TIP]
>
> ### No problem solving in the stand-up!
>
> When someone mentions a problem, it's not the time to discuss **solutions**. The goal is to identify blockers and plan the day.
