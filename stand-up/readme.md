# Standup

## Learning Objectives

Stand-up meetings are often a daily occurrence for software development teams. Even if a team does not use the agile methodology, having daily stand-up meetings enables teams to discuss their progress and identify blockers.

We want to get in the habit of having a stand-up meeting so that you can practice:
- giving technical updates and describing problems 
- public speaking
- get in the habit of having stand-up

### ðŸ§© Time to Have a First Standup

1. Split up into breakout rooms 
2. Take turns to describe what you worked on this week, something that is blocking you or that you struggled with (do not discuss solutions yet) and what you plan to work on today. If you need help or want to pair with someone to work on something specific this is a time to communicate that!
3. After everyone has given an update, reflect on next steps together. Is there something that multiple people said they struggled with that you could team up with? Is someone working on something interesting that you want to know more about? 
4. Where else can you ask a question and in which slack channels when you have a problem?
