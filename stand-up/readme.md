# Stand-up [PD 30 minutes]üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Stand-up meetings are often a daily occurrence for software development teams. Even if a team does not follow the [agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), stand-up meetings are effective to discuss progress and identify blockers.

What is a typical stand-up meeting? 
- Occurs daily
- Typically short (think 15 minutes). Traditional stand-up meetings require everyone to stand so that the meeting remains short.
- Should be a focused meeting where all team members disseminate the following information:
  - What they worked on yesterday
  - What issues are blocking them / What Problems did they encounter?
  - What they will work on today
- Stays away from problem-solving. Typically, problem-solving should occur separately, such as immediately after the standup is completed.

## Learning Objectives üôÜ

After this workshop, every participant:

- [ ] Has participated in a stand-up meeting and can explain what the structure is
- [ ] Can formulate their update in the typical "stand-up" structure and describe technical problems / blockers

## Set up üåº

- Split up into breakout rooms of 5 - 10 people

## üß© Time to Have a First Stand-up 

1. Take turns to describe
   - what you worked on this week,
   - something that is blocking you or that you struggled with (do not discuss solutions yet)
   - and what you plan to work on today. If you need help or want to pair with someone to work on something specific this is a time to communicate that!
1. After everyone has given an update, reflect on next steps together. Is there something that multiple people said they struggled with that you could team up with? Is someone working on something interesting that you want to know more about? 
1. Where else can you ask a question and in which slack channels when you have a problem?
