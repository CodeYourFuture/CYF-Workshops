# Using (and getting value from) a project boards

Project boards are a key tool used by teams to manage their work. Let's find out together why.

## Discussion (20 min)
Make a circle with the trainees (if you have more than 20 people in class, split it into 2 groups)
Each trainee should answer the following question:

- Why do we use project boards and tickets?
- Have you heard of reading from the right to the left? And can you explain it to the group
- Can you explain the concepts for work in progress?
- What are work in progress limits and how are they useful?
_PS: If no one knows the answers, google it and discuss it_

## Exercise (30 min)
Separate teams in groups of 4 (3 developers and 1 QA)

Make a copy of this [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVIaCPw8Q=/?share_link_id=369053535597).

Look at the board and discuss:
- Which ticket would you pick up first and why?
- How should we prioritise tickets in each column?
- How can we be effective at moving tickets to done?
- Could we remove something from the board?
- How can you ask for help or give help to your peer?
- How can I tell my team just with this board where I am at with my ticket?
- We discussed a teamwork board. Can any of the things we learned today be applied to your individual coursework board?

## Wrap up (10 min)
Make a circle with the trainees
Each trainee should share one thing they learned today
