# Using (and getting value from) a project boards

Project boards are a key tool used by teams to manage their work. Let's find out together why.

## Discussion (15 min)

Make a circle with the trainees (if you have more than 20 people in class, split it into 2 groups)

Each trainee should answer the following question:

- What problems are we trying to solve with project boards and tickets?
- Have you heard of reading from the right to the left? And can you explain it to the group?
- Can you explain the concepts for work in progress?
- What are work in progress (WIP) limits and how are they useful? How should we set them?

_PS: If no one knows the answers, Google it and discuss it_

## Exercise (25 min)

Separate teams in groups of 4.

3 people should take on the role of "developer" and one person the role of "QA".

Make a copy of this [Miro board. The board tracks is for a project which tracks to progress of trainees](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVIaCPw8Q=/?share_link_id=369053535597).

Look at the board and discuss:
- What is each column for? Why is each column useful?
- What WIP (work in progress) limits may we want to apply to each column?
- Which ticket would you pick up first and why?
- What information could help us decide when we're not sure?
- How should we prioritise tickets in each column?
- How can we be effective at moving tickets to done?
- Is there anything we could remove from the board?
- How can you ask for help from your team or give help to your peer?
- How can I tell my team just with this board where I am at with my ticket?
- We discussed a teamwork board. Can any of the things we learned today be applied to your individual coursework board?

## Wrap up (5 min)

Make a circle with the trainees.

Each trainee should share one thing they learned today.
