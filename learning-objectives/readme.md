# Learning objectives at CYF

Learn to write learning objectives that are testable and start with an active verb.

## Learning Objectives

```objectives
- [ ] Explain the CYF approach to writing learning objectives
- [ ] Revise three learning objectives to fit the CYF approach
```

What is a [good learning objective](https://teachtogether.tech/en/#s:process-objectives)? How do we revise learning objectives to fit the CYF approach? There are two key methods:

1. Start with an [active verb](https://bloomstaxonomy.net/).

2. Make your objective **testable.**

In other words:

> Instead of a state of* being*, choose an act of _doing_.

It's common for people to begin writing learning objectives that are generally phrased like this:

"Be able to understand this concept."

Let's revise this.

1. Start with the verb:

~~Be able to~~ understand this concept.

"Understand this concept."

2. Make it testable. How will the learner <span style="text-decoration:underline;">demonstrate</span> this understanding?

"~~Understand~~ Solve three problems about this concept."

That's it.

Please now explain in writing, in your own words, how to construct a learning objective. Write this in your own notes.

Next, there are exercises for you to complete to consolidate your understanding.

## Worksheet

### Here are three concrete examples:

#### Example 1

The learner should be familiar with the VSCode interface.

~~The learner should be familiar with~~ **Open** the terminal, command palette, and find panel in the VSCode interface.

#### Example 2

Be able to ask a good question.

~~Be able to understand how to~~ **Ask** a ~~good ~~question using the formal language defined in this workshop.

#### Example 3

Feel confident with higher order functions.

~~Feel confident with~~ **Use** higher order functions to solve array and object method problems.

### Now here are three learning objectives for you to revise.

#### Objective 1

Know how to respond to feedback during code review.

#### Objective 2

Be able to refactor a large function into several smaller single-responsibility functions.

#### Objective 3

Believe in their own ability to succeed.
