# Intro to git recap session / workshop

Topics: pair programming, git basics, pull requests, clone, fork

## Getting setup 💻

Please follow the steps below:


1. The whole group should split up into separate breakout rooms. Then in each breakout room each pair should be assigned a letter from the alphabet starting at "A". So if one breakout room includes 8 people then you should end up with 4 pairs: pair A, pair B, pair C and pair D.

1. In your pairs, label yourselves person 1 and person 2 - it doesn't matter who is 1 or 2, you'll end up swapping. 😄

2. You should swap roles frequently during this activity.
To begin with, **Person 1** **fork** this repository and **clone** it to your local machine.

3. Person 2 should clone Person 1's fork to their local machine.


## Answering questions ❓

In this next section, you'll need to answer some questions ❓

**N.B.: You may struggle to answer some or all of the questions in this section: however, we're not trying to trick you or catch you out! It's important you try answering in your own terms in this section! You'll really feel the benefit fromm trying to answer questions that may appear tricky at first.**


So for the first question, Person 1 and Person 2 can read the first question.

- Person 2 try and answer the question out loud in your own words.
- Person 1 should write down Person 1's answer in the file and then commit and push your changes.
- Person 2 should then pull down the answer to their local machine.

❗🕥 Don't spend longer than 3 minutes on each question

Then swap over ( so Person 1 now becomes Person 2 and vice versa ) and try the next question.

You'll find the first question in `questions/0.md`


## Whole group discussion

After you've answered questions. The whole group should go through the questions and a volunteer can invite responses from the different pairs. This is a good opportunity to correct, clarify and consolidate our answers collectively. 


## Review time

After the group discussion, every pair should raise a PR from Person 1's forked repo to the origin repo. Then ask for feedback by [requesting a review of the PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) from the pair that is sat to the right of you. Each pair should then [review the PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request) they've been requested to review.

Pair A should review Pair B, Pair B should review Pair C, Pair C should review Pair D, Pair D should review Pair A etc.
