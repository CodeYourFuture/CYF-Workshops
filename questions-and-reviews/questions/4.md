Q: What is the difference between a fork and cloned repository?

A: {YOUR ANSWER HERE}
fork is copy of a repository from the owner to a new account but cloned repository is when we copy our repo on our local machine to work locally and finally make a change in our github.

Remember to commit and push when you're finished!
