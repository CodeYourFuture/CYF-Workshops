You've started to see **assertions** in your coursework that look something like this:

```js
expect(sum(10,32)).toBe(42);
```

a) Describe, in your own words, what the above assertion checks.
The assertion expect(sum(10,32)).toBe(42); the function sum returns 42 when given the inputs 10 and 32. If the function returns 42, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

Now try the following:

b) Write an **assertion** that checks that a function `isMultipleOfTen` returns `true` when called with the input `80`
You can check out the [Jest documentation here](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#matchers) to help you with this task.
expect(isMultipleOfTen(80)).toBe(true);
