# Code comprehension

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctrl + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

Consider the code in this program below:

```js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function logSum(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

const result1 = calculateSum(10, 32);
const result2 = logSum(10, 32);
```

a) what will `result1` evaluate to? Explain your answer
-The calculateSum function takes two arguments (a and b), adds them together, and returns the result.

b) What will `result2` evaluate to? Explain your answer
-The logSum function adds a and b, then logs the result to the console using console.log(a + b).

c) Try to summarise the main difference between `logSum` and `calculateSum`
-calculateSum returns the result of a + b, allowing you to use that value elsewhere in your code.

-logSum prints the result to the console but does not return anything.
