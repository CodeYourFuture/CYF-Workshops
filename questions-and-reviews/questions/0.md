# Code comprehension

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctrl + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

Consider the code in this program below:

```js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function logSum(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

const result1 = calculateSum(10, 32);
const result2 = logSum(10, 32);
```

a) what will `result1` evaluate to? Explain your answer

b) What will `result2` evaluate to?

c) Try to summarise the main difference between `logSum` and `calculateSum`

{YOUR ANSWERS HERE}
a) result 1 will evaluate to 42. The function calculates sum will return the sum of the two arguments
b) it will return undefined because the function does not return anything but console.log the sum of the argument
c) logSum will only log the answer where as calculateSum will return the sum that can be reusable
