# 📢 Pitch Camp for ⚡ Lightning Talks

### Welcome

Hey everyone, welcome to our Pitch Camp for Tech Demos. This is a quick, **one-hour workshop** where we're going to help you nail the first minute of your lightning talk for a tech demo. It's inspired by [Fast Forward's cool approach](https://www.ffwd.org/pitchcamp/) to elevator pitches but tweaked for tech demos, especially for you.

### Who's This For?

If you're a junior developer getting ready for any kind of tech presentation - think Friday demos, hackathons, interviews, meetups, or even bigger stages - this is for you. We're here to help you start strong and grab your audience's attention.

### Goals

**Get to the Point:** We'll help you boil down your project to a few punchy sentences that make people want to listen.
**Hook Your Audience Fast:** Learn how to make your first minute so interesting that your audience can't help but pay attention.
**Feedback is Gold:** You'll get to practice your start and tweak it with advice.

### Pre-Work

Before you come, think about your project and what makes it cool. What's the most interesting thing about it? What's the problem it solves or will solve? What's the most surprising thing you've learned so far? We'll use this to build your opening.

Each person, make a copy of [Fast Forward's Pitch Camp Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gfkKPAHNKCdrS3A7nai51iK4gkJcna4B1tOk98ZKCUw/copy) and fill it out before the workshop.

### 2. Pitch to a Partner (10 minutes):

<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Pitch to a partner">}}-->

Set a timer for 10 minutes and break into pairs. Each person will pitch their opening to their partner. Keep your eyes on the time and stop talking after 60 seconds.

After you have both pitched, each partner will give feedback on what they liked and what could be improved. Some questions to guide feedback:

- Did you understand what the project was about?
- Should I speak slower or faster?
- What was the most interesting part?

### 3. Revise and Review (10 minutes):

<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Revise">}}-->

Set a timer for 10 minutes and revise your opening based on the feedback you received. Include a quantifiable metric if you can. Review your worksheet and make sure you've covered all the points.

### 4. Pitch again (10 minutes)

<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Pitch to a new partner">}}-->

Set a timer for 10 minutes and pair up with a new partner. Pitch your opening again and get more feedback. Make notes on what you want to change or improve.
