# Components are Functions

Today we're going to think some more about components. We're going to build a page using a design system and we're going to collaborate on a sub branch, feature branch workflow. We're going to identify the difference between HTML and the DOM using Devtools. And we're going to create new DOM nodes using JavaScript functions. Oh my goodness, it's so many things! That's why it's best to do this workshop after you've done:

- [x] [HTML-CSS](https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/html-css/)
- [x] [JS1](https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/js1/)
- [x] [JS2](https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/js2/)

And in particular, these workshops:

- [x] [Git](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Workshops/tree/main/git-day-1)
- [x] [Devtools](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Workshops/tree/main/devtools)
- [x] [Components 101](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Workshops/tree/main/components-1)

If you missed these workshops in your cohort, it's a good idea to try to do them in the week (online) first. Record your session for people that can't attend. Everyone should try to do the workshops first, either in groups or solo if necessary.

The overall mission is to compose "components" / groupings of HTML elements to build a page in [together.html](https://cyf-workshops.netlify.app/components-2/together.html).

But this time, we're going to use JavaScript functions to build our components.

```

<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Set up your working branch 15m">}}-->

### Set up your working branch

Everyone should do this so everyone is set up correctly.

1. You will be working on a special branch called [FOR-USE-IN-CLASS](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Workshops/tree/FOR-USE-IN-CLASS).
1. First, **clone** [the workshops repository](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Workshops/)
   Checkout `git switch FOR-USE-IN-CLASS`
1. Your cohort has a named _sub branch_. Everyone, check that out next with `git switch --create COHORT` (eg `NW6`). This is your working branch.

Check you are in the right place with GitLens!

### Visualise this Git workflow

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit "main"
    branch FOR-USE-IN-CLASS
    checkout FOR-USE-IN-CLASS
    branch NW6
    checkout NW6
    branch feature/header
    commit
    commit
    checkout NW6
    branch feature/footer
    commit
    commit
    commit
    checkout NW6
    branch feature/card
    commit
    commit
    commit
    checkout NW6
    branch feature/menu
    commit
    commit
    commit
    checkout NW6
    merge feature/header
    merge feature/footer
    merge feature/card
    merge feature/menu
```

<!--{{<note type="tip" title="Your working branch is your cohort name">}}-->

Your COHORT branch is your cohort name. It might be NW6, WM5, GL7... You'll be making branches starting from your COHORT branch and NOT starting from main.

<!--{{</note>}}-->

### Get set up to work in teams

Next, divide the class into four teams: header, footer, card, menu. Use the [team generator](https://cyf-workshops.netlify.app/components-2/teams.html) to help you do this.

Set a whole class [timer for 10 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=10+minute+time).

<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Set up your branch 10m">}}-->

### Each team, choose a driver

1. Driver, ask everyone in your team to confirm you are in the right working branch.
1. Driver, from this branch, create and checkout a new branch for your team named like this: `feature/cohort-component`, where _cohort_ is your cohort name and _component_ is the component you're building, for example: `feature/nw6-header`

```bash
git switch --create feature/cohort-component
```

Now you're all set up to make changes to together.html.

<!--{{</note>}}-->

### Find your docs

Set a whole class [timer for 10 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=10+minute+timer).

<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Find your docs 10m">}}-->

Deployed from this repo is a [mini design system](https://cyf-workshops.netlify.app/components-2). This design system has several documented components, and some also have JavaScript files.

Your mission is to find the docs for each component with an associated script file, and read them. Discuss your findings. Here are some things to consider:

Look at the pages on the website with Devtools. Compare the Inspect view with the source code you can see in the files. How are they different? How are HTML and the DOM different?

[What is a module](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-modules-beginners-guide/)? What does this code do `<script type="module">import Header from "./docs/header/header.js";</script>` ?

<!--{{</note>}}-->

### Together separately

Set a whole class [timer for 30 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=30+minute+timer).

<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Parallel Development 30m">}}-->

Now **build** your component. Elect a new driver.

1. Find [together.html](https://cyf-workshops.netlify.app/components-2/together.html) in the /components-2 directory. Your mission is to complete this page.
1. In the correct portion of the page, make your changes to build _your feature_ on together.html.
1. Driver, commit your changes to your feature branch.
1. Open a pull request from your branch to the COHORT branch, with your changes. Ask for help!
1. Remember, docs will help you too.
1. Do the simplest thing that could possibly work to begin with. You can always update your PR with more changes.

<!--{{</note>}}-->

### Review and merge

Now we're going to review each other's work and merge to our cohort branch.

Your COHORT branch is your cohort name. You're working in your COHORT branch and _not_ in main. Open your pull request to your COHORT branch.

<!--{{<note type="warning" title="Your working branch is your cohort name">}}-->

Don't open PRs to main. If you do open a PR to main and it is merged then it would break the exercise for other trainees.

<!--{{</note>}}-->

### Visualise this Git workflow

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "start"
    branch FOR-USE-IN-CLASS
    branch COHORT
    branch feature/component
    commit id: "import component function"
    commit id: "import data"
    commit id: "lighthouse revisions"
    checkout COHORT
    merge feature/component
```

Set a whole class [timer for 20 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=30+minute+timer).

<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Review 20m">}}-->

1. Go to the [pull requests](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Workshops/pulls) for this repo.
1. Either individually or as a group, review each other's PRs.
1. Once you're all happy with the PR, merge it.
1. Did it work? Why/why not? What does "work" mean for this workshop? Discuss.
