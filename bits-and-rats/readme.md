# 🧪 The Poisoned Wine Puzzle Workshop

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this workshop, you should have done the [Logic prep from the SDC](https://sdc.codeyourfuture.io/logic/), and worked through the 1000 wine bottle problem already. If you haven't done that course, this game will be a bit bewildering, so you might want to watch this video together first:

## 🎭 The Story

{{<note title="A long awaited party" type="activity">}}
**The King** has stocked his wine cellar with one thousand bottles of wine for his birthday party tomorrow. However, the King's evil brother, the Duke, has poisoned one of the bottles! The poison is lethal and will kill anyone who takes even one sip within one hour. You, the Butler, must find the poisoned bottle and save the party! But how?
{{</note>}}

## 🎩 The Players

- 🤵🏻 **Butlers**: The players who will be planning the tests.
- 🍾 **Bottles**: The players who will be tested.
- 🐀 **Rats**: The players who will be testing the bottles.

## 🎮 Setup

> [!TIP]
> How you play this game depends on how many people you have. If you have fewer than 12 people go to [Small Group Workshop](#small-group-version). If you have 12+ people, read on.

You will need:

- paper or sticky notes
- pens
- a space large enough to stand in formation

Before you begin. **Facilitator**, make up a stack of pieces of paper with either 1 or 0 written on. You're going to hand each bottle player 8 pieces of paper. For 8 bottle players, you're going to need:

- 7 x 8 pieces with 1
- 1 x 8 pieces with 0

The "zeroes" bottle is the poisoned bottle. You must choose one player to give the zeroes stack to. It's important that no players know which bottle is poisoned. Fold the paper over so nobody can see whose stack has the zeroes.

Now assign the roles randomly and hand the bottle players their pieces of paper.

### 🌱 Round 1: "The Simple Search" (4 Bottles)

Four people will be bottles. Two people will be rats. Everybody else will be the butlers and come up with a testing strategy. This is your training round. Take your time to understand the game. Success is finding the poisoned bottle.

Four (4) 🍾 **Bottles**, stand in any order the **🤵🏻 Butler** asks.

Two (2) 🐀 **Rats**, follow the directions of your **🤵🏻 Butler/s**. For each round of testing you must go to the bottle or bottles directed and ask for a piece of paper.

🍾 **Bottles**, when a 🐀 **Rat** comes to you, hand them one of your slips of paper. Don't peek!

🐀 **Rats**: 🔀 Shuffle your papers if you get more than one, please!

_When the **🤵🏻 Butler** yells 🧪 TEST..._

🐀 **Rats** open all your paper slips. If you have a `0` on _any_ of your slips, please die as dramatically as you can manage.

**🤵🏻 Butler**, when you are ready to guess the poisoned 🍾 **Bottle**, go to the 🍾 **Bottle** and ask for their slip.

#### Victory condition:

If the paper has a `0` you have won the game! Move to Round 2.
If the paper has a `1` you have lost, alas! Switch roles and play another round with just 4 bottles.

### 🌿 Round 2: "Resource Management" (8 Bottles)

- Eight (8) **🍾 Bottles**, stand in any order the **🤵🏻 Butlers** ask and get ready to hand out your slips.
- Three (3) **🐀 Rats**, get ready to do your most elaborate death, please!

As before, for each round of testing, rats must go to the bottle or bottles directed and ask for a piece of paper. 🔀 Shuffle your papers if you get more than one, please!

_When the **🤵🏻 Butler** yells 🧪 TEST..._

🐀 **Rats** open all your paper slips. If you have a `0` on _any_ of your slips, please die as dramatically as you can manage.

**🤵🏻 Butler**, when you are ready to guess the poisoned 🍾 **Bottle**, go to the 🍾 **Bottle** and ask for their slip.

#### Victory condition:

If the paper has a `0` you have won the game! Move to Round 3.
If the paper has a `1` you have lost, alas! Switch roles and play another round.

### 🌳 Round 3: "The Time Crunch" (16 Bottles)

You may have to switch to the [small group version](#small-group-version) at this point.

The final challenge! Lots of bottles, few rats, and only one chance to test. You have 16 bottles, 4 rats, and 1 test. Good luck!

## 🐁 Small Group Version

</summary>

If you have fewer than 12 people, you can still play this game! Nobody will play bottles; everyone will play rats and butlers. Lay the stacks of papers out in a grid. You might want to number the stacks to make it easier to track.

Rats will come up and take a piece of paper from the grid. Just as in the original game, when the butler yells TEST, the rats will open their papers. If they have a `0` they die. If they have a `1` they live. The butler must guess which stack paper has the `0` on it.

## 🌟 Pro Tips for Facilitators

</summary>

1. As nobody knows who is the poisoned bottle, the bottles and rats are free to help the butler with their strategy if you choose.
1. Physical movement helps learning! Encourage people to ham it up and act out their roles.
1. Use clear commands:

   ```
   "Bottles being tested by Rat 1..."
   "RAISE HANDS!"
   "Lock it in!"
   ```

1. Between rounds, ask:
   - What worked?
   - What was tricky?
   - What patterns did you spot?
1. Success looks like...

- Players getting faster each round
- "Aha!" moments when binary patterns click
- Excited discussion about testing strategies
- Clear explanations of why solutions work
