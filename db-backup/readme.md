- Check the acceptance criteria on the **Setup your local development environment** issue. Has everyone in your team met the acceptance criteria for this issue?


### Part 2 - Set up your local database

- Set a whole class timer for 15 mins ⏱️
- Use the instructions for the [db setup guide](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Full-Stack-Project-Assessment/tree/main/guides/db-setup) to set up a local database with one table and some data. Use the first section in the instructions to complete this task.
- Check the acceptance criteria on the **Setup your local database** issue. Which criteria have you met?


### Part 3 - Backup your local database

- Set a whole class timer for 15 mins ⏱️
- Use the instructions for the [db setup guide](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Full-Stack-Project-Assessment/tree/main/guides/db-setup) to backup your local database
- Check the acceptance criteria on the **Setup your local database** issue. Which criteria have you met?


### Part 4 - Remove, Re-store, and Restoring

- Check the acceptance criteria on the **Setup your local database** issue. Which criteria have you met?


### Practice Makes Perfect

Set another timer and repeat the dropping, re-initializing, and restoring process a few more times to solidify your understanding. Experiment with different backup file locations if you'd like.

By the end of this workshop, you should feel confident in creating, removing, re-initializing, and backing up your database so you don't need to worry about losing your data.

### Acceptance Criteria

Double-check the acceptance criteria on the issues: **Setup your local development environment** and **Setup your local database**

By completing these steps, you've mastered the fundamentals of database setup for the Full Stack Assessment, and you're ready to tackle the next challenge!
