## Full Stack Assessment Database Workshop: Initialize, Remove, Re-initialize, and Backup!

This workshop will guide you through setting up, removing, re-initializing, and most importantly, backing up your database for the Full Stack Assessment.

### Learning Objectives:

```objectives
- [ ] Find the Database Level instructions in the Full Stack Project Assessment.
- [ ] Initialize a new database.
- [ ] Remove a database.
- [ ] Re-initialize a database.
- [ ] Create a backup of your database.
```

## Requirements

- Clone the Full Stack Project Assessment repository to your local machine.
- Complete step 1 of the database level instructions (look at the Assessment for details).
- Have a code editor or terminal ready.

**Come to class with your updated `initdb.sql` file.** You'll use this file to create and populate your database.

### Initiating the Database

<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Init and seed">}}-->

1. **Create the Database:** Use the `createdb` command to create a new database called videorec:

```bash
createdb videorec
```

#### Initial Data Load: (5 minutes)

Populate the database with initial data:

```bash
psql -d videorec < db/initdb.sql
```

<details>
<summary>Let's just parse that command clearly:</summary>

1. `psql` : Use the PostgreSQL command-line interface.
2. `-d` : This flag marks the next argument as the database name.
3. `videorec` : The name of the database you want to populate.
4. `<` : The following file will be used as input.
5. `db/initdb.sql` : The path to the SQL file to populate the database.

</details>

<!--{{<note type="tip" title"Connectivity">}}-->

Depending how postgresql was installed for you, you might need to add some connectivity details to both createdb and psql: `psql -h localhost -U username -d videorec < db/initdb.sql` In this example you ask postgres to connect to your local database through localhost and use username as the user.

<!--{{</note>}}>-->

#### Backup the Database:

<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Backup">}}-->

Now, let's create a compressed archive of your database for safekeeping. Use the `pg_dump` command with the following options:

```bash
pg_dump -h localhost -U username videorec > videorec_backup.sql.gz
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation:</summary>

- `pg_dump`: This command is designed specifically for creating PostgreSQL database backups.
- `-h localhost` (Optional): Specify the host (`localhost` in most cases) if your PostgreSQL installation differs.
- `-U username` (Optional): Include your username if required for connection.
- `videorec`: This is the name of the database you want to back up.
- `> videorec_backup.sql.gz`:\*\* This defines the filename and format for the backup. The `>` redirects the output to a file, and `.sql.gz` indicates a gzipped SQL archive.

</details>

**Verification:** Check your terminal or file explorer to confirm the existence of the backup file (`videorec_backup.sql.gz`).

<details>
<summary>Stretch: Customize Backup Location</summary>

- You can modify the output filename and location to suit your preference. For example:

```bash
pg_dump -h localhost -U username videorec > backups/videorec_backup_$(date +"%Y-%m-%d").sql.gz
```

- This command incorporates the current date in the filename for easy identification and versioning.

### Removing, Re-initializing, and Restoring (10 minutes)

Now that we have a backup, let's practice removing and re-initializing the database:

<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Drop!">}}-->

1. **Drop the Database:** Use the `dropdb` command followed by the database name (`videorec`) to remove the database:

```bash
dropdb videorec
```

**Confirmation:** Verify that the database is gone by trying to connect to it with `psql -d videorec`. You should receive an error message indicating the database doesn't exist.

<!--{{</note>}}>-->
<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Restore! 10m">}}-->

1. **Recreate the Database:** Use the same `createdb` command from before to create a new empty database with the same name (`videorec`):

```bash
createdb videorec
```

2. **Restore from Backup:** Use `psql` with the `-f` flag to specify the backup file and restore the data into the newly created database:

```bash
psql -d videorec -f videorec_backup.sql.gz
```

3. **Verify:** Connect to the database (`psql -d videorec`) to confirm the tables and data have been restored successfully.

<!--{{</note>}}>-->

### Practice Makes Perfect

Set another timer and repeat the dropping, re-initializing, and restoring process a few more times to solidify your understanding. Experiment with different backup file locations if you'd like.

By the end of this workshop, you should feel confident in creating, removing, re-initializing, and backing up your database so you don't need to worry about losing your data.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Working Database:** You should now have a functional `videorec` database populated with the initial data from `initdb.sql`.
- **Multiple Removals and Re-initializations:** Practice dropping and recreating the database to gain confidence in the process.
- **Database Backups:** You can successfully create backups of your database and restore from them.

By completing these steps, you've mastered the fundamentals of database management for the Full Stack Assessment, and you're ready to tackle the next challenge!
