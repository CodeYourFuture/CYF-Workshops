**Very tricky**


2 people (Person A and Person B) are working on a project.
At the moment, the code for their project is hosted on Github.
The `main` branch of the repository on Github looks like this:

```mermaid
---
title: main branch on Github. Diagram 1
---
gitGraph
   commit id:"edc123"
   commit id:"ad127x"
   commit id:"r5z89t"
```

Person A and B both clone the repo as it is in Diagram 1.

Person B then commits locally and pushes their work Github. The repo on Github and Person B's machine now looks like this:

```mermaid
---
title: main branch on Github and Person B's local machine. Diagram 2
---
gitGraph
   commit id:"edc123"
   commit id:"ad127x"
   commit id:"r5z89t"
   commit id:"fg561s" type: HIGHLIGHT
```

Meanwhile, Person A commits on their local machine. Now on Person A's machine they have the following:


```mermaid
---
title: PersonA's local machine. Diagram 3
---
gitGraph
   commit id:"edc123"
   commit id:"ad127x"
   commit id:"r5z89t"
   commit id:"zx5612" type: HIGHLIGHT
```

What happens now when Person A tries to push their work to Github using Github desktop? Look at the options below:

a) 

The Github repo looks like this:

```mermaid
---
title: PersonA's local machine. Diagram 3
---
gitGraph
   commit id:"edc123"
   commit id:"ad127x"
   commit id:"r5z89t"
   commit id:"zx5612" type: HIGHLIGHT
   commit id:"fg561s" type: HIGHLIGHT
```

b) 

The Github repo looks like this:

```mermaid
---
title: PersonA's local machine. Diagram 3
---
gitGraph
   commit id:"edc123"
   commit id:"ad127x"
   commit id:"r5z89t"
   commit id:"fg561s" type: HIGHLIGHT
   commit id:"zx5612" type: HIGHLIGHT
```

c) 

The Github repo looks like this:

```mermaid
---
title: PersonA's local machine. Diagram 3
---
gitGraph
   commit id:"edc123"
   commit id:"ad127x"
   commit id:"r5z89t"
   commit id:"zx5612" type: HIGHLIGHT
```

d) We get an error. 

The most important thing in this question is to try and describe your reasoning/thought process out loud.
