**Trickier**

In VSCode, [open your terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics#_terminal-shells).

In this exercise, you'll need to run each of the commands below in the terminal.
After running each command, describe what you think the commmand is doing ( it doesn't matter if you have/haven't used the commands before )

1. ls

2. ls -a

3. pwd

4. git log

You've seen the output for command 4. using other tools. Try and find some other places where you can see a similar output to the command for 4. Hint: Look on Github Desktop and github.com
