# Buttons and Counter

This app currently features a button that increments a counter.

## Task for Person 1

Create and switch to a new branch named `split-app-components`:

```
git switch -c split-app-components
```

Split the header and main content into two seperate files. Use the new functions to refactor the App function.

## Task for Person 2

Create and switch to a new branch named `add-decrement-button`:

```
git switch -c add-decrement-button
```

Unskip the tests that describe the decrement button, then in the app add the new decrement button. Make sure to update the description of the app in the header.
