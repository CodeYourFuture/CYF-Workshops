# Prioritisation & Estimation

## Introduction to Prioritization (20 mins)

Your objective in this section is to understand why prioritization matters in software development.

1 minute: Individually, think of as many reasons as you can that prioritisation matters in software development.

4 minutes: Go around the group sharing these reasons.

<details>

<summary>Hint for volunteers</summary>

Make sure we've covered:

* Teams can't build everything at once due to time, budget, and resource constraints.
* There are different ways we can prioritise the features, refer to pre-reading required for the class.
* Prioritization frameworks like Value vs. Effort help focus on high-impact features.

</details>

Activity (15 mins): Form groups of about 3 and discuss following:

* 5 mins: Individually review [the suggested features in chat app backlog](https://sdc.codeyourfuture.io/decomposition/sprints/2/prep/#chat-application-requirements) (e.g., message reactions, scheduled messages, formatting, replies). Feel free to add your own suggestions too.
* 10 mins: Write responses for following questions and discuss within your group:
  1. How would you decide what to build first?
  2. What would your prioritisation methodology be based on?
  3. Which features do you think a software development team at WhatsApp prioritized in their first 6 months?

## Value vs. Effort Matrix Explained (10 mins)

<details>

<summary>Hint for volunteers</summary>

Make sure we emphasize that the Value vs. Effort framework is one of the most commonly used frameworks for beginner level product development teams and cover below aspects of the Framework.

</details>

* **Value**: Benefits to users or business (e.g., user satisfaction, revenue).
* **Effort**: Time, complexity, and resources required.
* **Quadrants**:

|  | Low Value | High Value |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Low Effort | ***Maybes*** | ***Quick Wins*** |
| High Effort | ***Time Sink*** | ***Big Bets*** |

Example:

* *Quick Win*: Adding emoji reactions (high value, easy to implement).
* *Time Sink*: Custom animated avatars (low value, complex).

## Group Exercise: Feature Prioritization (40 mins)

### Step 1: Review Features (5 mins)

In your groups of about 3, spend the next 5 mins shortlisting 8–10 features from your initial features list. Find some examples below:

1. End-to-end encryption
2. Message editing
3. Group video calls
4. User profile customization
5. Message search
6. Chat history backup
7. Read receipts

### Step 2: Score Features (20 mins)

* 10 mins: Rate each feature's value (1–5 scale) and effort (1–5 scale).
* 10 mins: Plot them on a matrix (use whiteboards or printed templates or Mural).

<details>

<summary>Hint for volunteers</summary>

Make sure all teams understand the matrix has value on one axis and effort on the other.

</details>

Use below guiding questions to rate the features' value and effort:

* Value: How many users will benefit? Does it solve a core problem?
* Effort: How many developer hours would each feature take? Are there technical risks?

### Step 3: Debate & Finalize Priorities (15 mins)

<details>

<summary>Hint for volunteers</summary>

Teams must agree on quadrant placements.

</details>

In your groups of about 3, discuss following:

* 5 min: Which 2–3 features would you build first? Why?
* 5 min: What features are overlapping? Why?
* 5 min: Which features depend on other features development?

## Group Presentations & Discussion (15 mins)

5 mins presentation time per group: Select one person to present your decisions. Share your group's matrix and top priorities.

Discussion points for presenters from each group:

* Did your team disagree on scoring? How did they resolve it?
* What assumptions did you make about users or technical constraints?
* Would you deprioritise a high-value feature if it's too complex? Why?

## Reflection & Takeaways (5 mins)

Popcorn around the class and share your key takeaways from this workshop.

<details>

<summary>Hint for volunteers</summary>

Ensure the below points are emphasized:

* Prioritization forces trade-offs.
* You can't build everything.
* Quick wins build momentum; time sinks must be avoided..
