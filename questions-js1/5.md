Q: What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

A: {YOUR ANSWER HERE}

An expression is any word or group of words or symbols that is a value. In programming, an expression is a value, or anything that executes and ends up being a value.

Example:
const price = 500;

A statement is a group of expressions and/or statements that you design to carry out a task or an action.

Statements are two-sided â€“ that is, they either do tasks or don't do them. Any statement that can return a value is automatically qualified to be used as an expression. That is why a function or class is a statement and also an expression in JavaScript.
let amount = $2000;
