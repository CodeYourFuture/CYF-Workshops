Q: What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

A: {Expressions are unique in meaning, while statements are two-sided in execution. For example, 1 has a certain value while go( ) may be executed or not. Statements are the whole structure, while expressions are the building blocks. For example, a line or a block of code is a statement.

An expression statement is an expression used in a place where a statement is expected. The expression is evaluated and its result is discarded â€” therefore, it makes sense only for expressions that have side effects, such as executing a function or updating a variable.}
