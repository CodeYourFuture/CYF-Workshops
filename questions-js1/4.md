Q: What is the difference between defining and calling a function??

A: {Defining a function means creating the function and giving it a name and a set of instructions that it will execute when it is      called.

    Calling a function means invoking the function by using its name followed by parentheses, and passing any required arguments in the parentheses. When a function is called, it will execute the instructions defined in its body and may return a value.
