Q: What is the difference between defining and calling a function??

A: Defining a function is different from “calling a function.” When you “call” a function, you just write the name of the function followed by (); like this: nameOfFunctionToRun(); This will actually run the code inside that function, whereas defining the function does not run the code. It just defines the name.
