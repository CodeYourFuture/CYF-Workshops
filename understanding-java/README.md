# Understanding Java

No one (neither trainees nor volunteers) involved in this workshop needs to know Java.

The goal of this workshop is to work with code _even though we don't know the language_.

Trainees should be familiar with any programming language (e.g. JavaScript or Python), and should be comfortable searching for and reading documentation.

## Learning objectives

```objectives
- [ ] Make sense of code in a language you don't know.
- [ ] Identify similarities and differences between programming languages.
- [ ] Use documentation, debugging, and search techniques to fix a bug in a program in a language you don't know.
- [ ] Use documentation, debugging, and search techniques to extend a program in a language you don't know.
```

## Introduction

There are a lot of things in common across different programming languages.

Even if you don't know Java, knowing other languages gives you a basis for making sense of it.

All of your existing documentation/research/Googling skills will help you!

A sample complete implementation of this exercise can be found in https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Workshops/blob/main/understanding-java/DnsResolver.java but we recommend you try to completely solve the exercises yourself rather than looking at the sample implementation.

Get into groups of no more than 6.

## Understanding code (10 minutes)

Here is some Java code:

```java
class DnsResolver {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length != 1) {
            System.err.printf("Expected exactly one argument, but got %d%n", args.length);
            System.exit(1);
        }
        String host = args[0];

        String[] parts = host.split(".");
        System.out.printf("The top-level domain of the host %s is %s%n", host, parts[parts.length - 1]);
    }
}
```

Take 10 minutes to play computer with this code on your own. Read through it line-by-line and work out what you think each line does.

Identify what things you don't know, or haven't seen before in another language. Try to work out what they are. First make a guess, and if you're not confident, do some research.

Identify what things you _have_ seen in another language, and what the equivalent code in that language may be.

## Discuss new is similar and what is new (15 minutes)

Popcorn around your group discussing what things in this code are _similar_ to what you've seen in other languages, and what things are different.

Discuss the things that are different: What trade-offs do you think they bring? What extra value do they give compared to how things would look in other languages? What draw-backs do they have?

## Debugging code (15 minutes)

On your own, predict what you expect this code to do and print.

Save the above Java code to a file named `DnsResolver.java`. From the same directory as the file, run the following command:

```bash
javac DnsResolver.java && java DnsResolver google.com
```

This does two things - it _compiles_ the `DnsResolver.java` file into a file called `DnsResolver.class`, and then it runs that file with the argument `google.com`.

If you run this command, you may see different results than what you expect.

In your group, try to debug and fix this problem. Share theories about what's happening, suggest how you could get more information, and work together.

## Extending code (50 minutes)

Add additional code to the existing code to satisfy an additional requirement:

Resolve the DNS hostname passed as the program's command line argument, and print out the IP addresses it resolves to.

You can work on your own or in groups to do this.
