# Node workshop

In this workshop, we'll build up a NodeJS app from the ground up and check our understanding as we go along.

Remember to preview the `README` first.

## Level 600

Welcome to Node Workshop Level 600.

In this level, we've moved the albums data to another file `albums.js` to keep `app.js` tidier.

Read the source code in `app.js` and then predict what will happen when you call the endpoint `localhost:9090/albums`

What problem do you notice? Why is this happening?

error message, we haven't imported our albums yet

How can you fix this problem? Fix it, check it works and then commit ðŸ’ª
by exporting and importing the albums file
