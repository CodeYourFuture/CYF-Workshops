# Node workshop

In this workshop, we'll build up a NodeJS app from the ground up and check our understanding as we go along.

Remember to preview the `README` first.


## Level 300

Welcome to Node Workshop Level 300.

## Questions

Q1) Define an **API** 
Q2) What is the purpose of an **API**
Q3) Define an **endpoint**

If you're unsure about the questions above, then try starting a discussion with another pair.

## Requirements

For this endpoint, a client application should be able to make a GET request to the "/" endpoint at localhost:9090
and the server should respond with a message "You've successfully reached the server"

Firstly,

Q4) Look inside `app.js`.

On line 12, we need to pass some arguments ( inputs ) to the `app.get` method. 
What type of inputs should we pass to the `app.get` method? Use the express documentation to check your answer.
