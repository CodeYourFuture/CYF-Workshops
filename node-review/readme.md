# Node workshop

In this workshop, we'll build up a NodeJS app from the ground up and check our understanding as we go along.

Remember to preview the `README` first.


## Level 600

Welcome to Node Workshop Level 600.


In this level, we've moved the albums data to another file `albums.js` to keep `app.js` tidier.


Read the source code in `app.js` and then predict what will happen when you call the endpoint `localhost:9090/albums`


What problem do you notice? Why is this happening?
