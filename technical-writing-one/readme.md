## Requirements

> Every engineer is also a writer

In this workshop you will practice writing and reviewing technical documentation. This is a critical skill for any engineer. We will use the excellent [Google Technical Writing One](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one) workshop materials.

**This workshop will take at least two and a half hours.** Plan to spend a whole morning or whole afternoon on this workshop.

#### Note on AI

Throughout the course, we use Generative AI to help us write and review technical writing. This can be a practical way to get started, but it's important to understand the basic principles and develop your own judgment and clarity. AI frequently generates the _appearance_ of meaning without the substance. This can trick you into thinking your documentation looks good when it doesn't actually convey meaning or help anyone understand anything. Don't be Joey:
