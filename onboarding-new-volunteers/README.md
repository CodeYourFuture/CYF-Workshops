# Onboarding new volunteers

As a community, it's all of our job to make sure that on a volunteer's first day they:
* Feel welcomed
* Know what to do
* Feel empowered, not blocked or confused
* Know how to get help

In this workshop we will practice some of these skills.

Get into groups of about 5.

Take turns to role-play. Imagine we're in a class focusing on CSS flex-box and grid.

### Roles

One participant should act as an experienced volunteer.

One participant should act as a volunteer showing up to their first class. Pick one of these personas. Don't tell people which one you've chosen.
1. A professional frontend engineer with several years of experience. You know CSS well, but have never taught before.
2. A recent boot-camp graduate who has learnt CSS, but never used it outside of personal projects.
3. A professional backend engineer who knows many programming languages well, but doesn't know the particular CSS we're covering today.
4. A CYF graduate from a previous cohort which used a more lecture-style rather than flipped classroom.

The rest of the group should watch the exchange.

### Interaction

Experienced volunteer: Approach the new volunteer, and have a conversation. Your goal is to help them get started.

Aim for at most a 5 minute exchange.

When you're finished, have a discussion about what went well, and what could have gone better.

Write down takeaways which will help you have this conversation in real life.

### Discussion

Gather everyone together and compare your groups' takeaways.
