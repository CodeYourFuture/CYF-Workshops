Q: What is the difference between a fork and cloned repository?

A: {YOUR ANSWER HERE}

When you fork a repo from an github profile, the repo goes to be copied to your github profile, that means not your local computer

Clone is in order to copy the repo to your local computer

I am asking to teammate

that's my opnion 
A fork and a cloned repository are two different things in the context of Git and version control.

A fork is a copy of a repository that is hosted on a remote server (such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). When you fork a repository, you create a new, independent repository based on the original one. You can then make changes to the forked repository and push those changes to your remote copy, without affecting the original repository.

On the other hand, a clone is a local copy of a repository that you have cloned from a remote server. A clone includes all of the repository's files, as well as its entire history. You can make changes to a cloned repository and push those changes to a remote repository if you have write access. You can also create a new remote repository from a local clone, and push your changes there.

In summary, a fork is a remote repository, while a clone is a local repository. Both allow you to work with the code from the original repository, but in different ways.

Remember to commit and push when you're finished!
