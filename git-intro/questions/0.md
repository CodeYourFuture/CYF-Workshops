Q: What is the difference between a fork and cloned repository?

A: {Forking a repository is similar to copying a repository, with two major differences: You can use a pull request to suggest changes from your user-owned fork to the original repository in its GitHub instance, also known as the upstream repository.

Cloning a repository means that you're downloading a copy of the source code from source control. To use the iOS SDK you have to download the code from GitHub (ie- clone the iOS SDK repository). from a shell / command prompt. Cloning basically means you want to get a local copy of the code present in the repository.
}

Remember to commit and push when you're finished!
