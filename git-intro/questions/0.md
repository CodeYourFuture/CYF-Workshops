Q: What is the difference between a fork and cloned repository?

A: {YOUR ANSWER HERE}

When you fork a repo from an github profile, the repo goes to be copied to your github profile, that means not your local computer

Clone is in order to copy the repo to your local computer

Remember to commit and push when you're finished!
