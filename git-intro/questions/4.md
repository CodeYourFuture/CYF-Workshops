When you clone a repository off Github, it is connected to a remote repository on Github.
How can you check which remote repository your local repo is connected to on Github?

Make sure to label your remote and local repository the same name in order to recognise it.
git remote -v /command to check on terminal
Hint: Try researching to see if you can find a terminal command online
