        ...But they may feel frustrating at first! You are not expected to know
        the answers to all these problems. That's why we chose them. They were
        chosen so that everyone can have (at least one, hopefully more) question
        you don't know the answer to.

        The questions stored in the bank are all common blockers. These all
        expose common, wrong, mental models of HTML and CSS. These are
        simplified versions of problems that CYF trainees get stuck on for hours
        (or days) in coursework. Instead of getting frustrated and stuck on your
        own, let's encounter these collectively and <em>use</em> these blockers
        to develop our skills in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Breaking down problems</li>
        <li>Describing problems to others clearly</li>
        <li>Using a systematic method of inquiry</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Instead of flailing about, randomly trying stuff, attempting to memorise
        the internet, watching zillions of unrelated tutorials, getting
        frustrated and quitting coding...or any of the other totally normal,
        human responses we naturally have to being confounded.

              If you delete all the CSS from the styles.css in the Sources

                <li><strong> what actually happened</strong> the page used default styles like (white background,black text, normal font)</li>

            <ol>
            <li><strong>What I did:</strong> I checked the CSS and saw that the element has width: 100%.</li>
            <li><strong>What I expected:</strong> I expected the element to fill the whole page.</li>
            <li><strong>What actually happened:</strong> The element filled 100% of its parent container, not the whole page. Width: 100% means 100% of the parent element's width.</li>

              If you add the rule <code>!important</code> to line 8 of
              styles.css, what colour will this text be? Why?
            </p>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>What I did:</strong> I added <code>!important</code> to the color rule in line 8 of styles.css, targeting the element with id="important".</li>

            <li><strong>What I expected:</strong> I expected the text inside the element to turn red, because I used <code>!important</code> which should override other styles.</li>

            <li><strong>What actually happened:</strong> The text did not change color because the rule was targeting the &lt;li&gt; only, not the &lt;p&gt; tag. 
             The color from another rule (like <code>#important p { color: var(--ink); }</code>) was still applied. To fix it, 
             I changed the rule to <code>#important p { color: red !important; }</code> and then the text became red.</li>
