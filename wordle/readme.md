# Wordle CLI Workshop

This is a workshop where we, as a class, build a Wordle CLI clone in Node JS.

## Learning Objectives

```objectives
- [ ] Build a fully playable game from scratch, starting with nothing but an idea
- [ ] Give trainees some understanding of how to find and use NPM dependencies in a project
- [ ] Walk trainees through the process of breaking down a high-level idea into smaller, less intimidating bits of functionality
- [ ] Inspire trainees to take their own ideas and build something cool with whatever skills they have
```

## Requirements

- Split the cohort into groups of 3 to 4 people
- Introduction slides: https://barath-cyf.netlify.app/wordle/
- We start with an energiser where we play an actual game of Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) - sourcing guesses from the class, and hopefully learning how the game works in the process
- Ensure the class understands the rules of the game first
- Then we start building out our Wordle CLI clone from scratch
    - Referencing steps from this README: https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/wordle-clone-example#readme (this example solution can be given to the trainees after the session has finished)
    - Steps 1 & 2 can be done together as a class. All the code here should be sourced from the trainees themselves - this is their implementation. However, the volunteer who is running the workshop can ensure the high-level problem is broken down into these smaller functions: getRandomWord, getGuess and showWordWithHighlights
    - Step 3 (getRandomWord) can be done in groups
    - Step 4 (getGuess) can be done in groups - but it might be useful for a volunteer to suggest which NPM dependency we could use
    - Step 5 (showWordWithHighlights) can be done in groups - again, we can suggest which NPM dependency to use
    - Step 6 (improving the user experience) could possibly be done as a class together
- Back to the slides (https://barath-cyf.netlify.app/wordle/), we can wrap up the session by suggesting some stretch ideas, and again emphasizing the power of trainee ideas

## Acceptance Criteria

- I have a working Wordle CLI game which I can play
- I understand the code I have written
- I understand what a dependency is in Node and how to install and use them
