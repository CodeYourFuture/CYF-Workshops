# React + Vite + Express + Vitest

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. It's got a server set up with Express and a test runner set up with Vitest, but it isn't a full production setup. The aim of this template is to get out of your way and let you focus on writing your city guide app.

Write your Express server in `server/server.js` and your React app in `client/App.jsx`. You can use `index.html` for any static content you want to serve.
