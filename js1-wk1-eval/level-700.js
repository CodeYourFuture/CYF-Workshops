let total = console.log(10, 32);

console.log(total);

// Without running the code, predict and explain what total will evaluate to
// At first, the innermost console.log() in line 3 will output '10, 32' i.e. using the console.log() function that is a part of line 1 variable declaration.
// Then, the console.log() with the total as argument will not return anything or simply return "undefined" because the output of total
// will not be considered as a valid argument for the console.log() function.
