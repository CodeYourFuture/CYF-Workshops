let total = console.log(10,32);

console.log(total);

// Without running the code, predict and explain what total will evaluate to
 /*        Prediction and Explanation
 
The line let total = console.log(10, 32); uses console.log() to print the values 10 and 32 to the console. 
However, console.log() does not return a value; it only outputs to the console. 
The return value of console.log() is undefined.

Breakdown:
console.log(10, 32); will print 10 32 to the console.
let total = console.log(10, 32); will assign undefined to the variable total because console.log() returns undefined.
console.log(total); will then print undefined to the console.

Predicted Output
First, 10 32 will be printed to the console.
Then, undefined will be printed as the value of total.

Final Answer
total will evaluate to undefined.   */
