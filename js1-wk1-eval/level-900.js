const mitchAge = 33;
const grandFatherAge = 83;

// Create a variable called ageGap and assign to it the difference between grandFatherAge and mitchAge
/* const mitchAge = 33;

const grandFatherAge = 83;

// Calculate the age gap
const ageGap = grandFatherAge - mitchAge;

// Log the value of ageGap to the console
console.log(ageGap); */

// Log the value of ageGap to the console

/*   EXPLANATION
 ageGap is calculated as the difference between grandFatherAge and mitchAge, which would be 83 - 33 = 50.
The value 50 will be logged to the console. */
