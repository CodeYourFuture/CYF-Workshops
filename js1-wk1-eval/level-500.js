const avgDaysInYear = Math.floor(365 / 12);

// Without running any code,
// Predict and explain what the value of avgDaysInYear will evaluate to
// It will evaluate to 30
// Dividing 365 by 12 gives a floating number answer which will be about 30.4 or thereabouts. The method .floor will
// resolve the answer to the integer that is less than or equal to the number to which it is applied. So, we have 30.

// You can use documentation to look up what Math.floor does
