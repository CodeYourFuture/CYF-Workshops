const avgDaysInMonth = Math.floor(365 / 12);

// Without running any code,
// Predict and explain what the value of avgDaysInMonth will evaluate to 30
// You can use documentation to look up what Math.floor does
//Answer Because:
//365 / 12 ≈ 30.4166 and Math.floor takes this number and cuts off everything after the decimal, rounding down.
//So it simply becomes 30.
