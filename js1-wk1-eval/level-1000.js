// Without running code,

// Look up documentation for Math.abs if you've not used it before

console.log(Math.abs); // an error will be logged on to the console because the method is not complete, the bracket() is missing.
console.log(Math.abs()); //It will return NAN(Not A Number) because no value was assigned to it. This second line method is complete unlike the first line.
console.log(Math.abs(-100)); // this will return 100 because this method always return positive for any absolute value of integer.
