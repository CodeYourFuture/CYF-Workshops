// Use documentation to work out what updatedPost will evaluate to.
/*  The post.replaceAll('Facebook', 'Meta') expression replaces every occurrence of the word "Facebook" in the post string with "Meta".

Updated String Value
The original post contains one occurrence of "Facebook", so it will be replaced by "Meta".

// Don't run any code for this task
/*  Explanation
replaceAll() replaces all instances of the substring "Facebook" with "Meta" throughout the string. 
In this case, "Facebook" appears twice in the text, and both occurrences are replaced. */
