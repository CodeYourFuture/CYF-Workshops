# Code comprehension

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctrl + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

Consider the code in this program below:

```js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function logSum(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

const result1 = calculateSum(10, 32);
const result2 = logSum(10, 32);
```

a) what will `result1` evaluate to? Explain your answer
The value of result1 will be 42.
because when it call the function it will return 42, which is the sum of 10 & 32

b) What will `result2` evaluate to? Explain your answer
it will print 42 in screen. However, the value of result2 won't change.

c) Try to summarise the main difference between `logSum` and `calculateSum`

logSum: this function will print the sum of a and b.

calculateSum: this funciton will return the result of a+b.
