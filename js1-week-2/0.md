# Code comprehension

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:

Consider the code in this program below:

```js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function logSum(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

const result1 = calculateSum(10, 32);
const result2 = logSum(10, 32);
```

a) what will `result1` evaluate to? Explain your answer

b) What will `result2` evaluate to? Explain your answer

c) Try to summarise the main difference between `logSum` and `calculateSum`


{YOUR ANSWERS HERE}
a) The answer to result1 is 42. This is because calculateSum is a function that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum. In this case, the function is called with a equal to 10 and b equal to 32, so the returned value is 10 + 32 = 42.

b) The answer to result2 is evaluate to undefined. This is because logSum is a function that logs the sum of its two arguments to the console using console.log(), but it does not return a value. Therefore, when logSum(10, 32) is called, the function logs the sum 42 to the console but does not return anything, so result2 is undefined.

c) logSum logs the sum of its two arguments to the console using console.log(), while calculateSum returns the sum of its two arguments as a value.
