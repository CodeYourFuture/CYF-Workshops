# Code comprehension

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctrl + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

Consider the code in this program below:

```js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function logSum(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

const result1 = calculateSum(10, 32);
const result2 = logSum(10, 32);
```

a) what will `result1` evaluate to? Explain your answer

b) What will `result2` evaluate to? Explain your answer

c) Try to summarise the main difference between `logSum` and `calculateSum`


The function  calculateSum takes two arguments and returns the value of those arguments added together (summed)

a) the sum of the two parameters is stored in result1 evaluate to 42
 
b) result2 will log out the sum but doesn't return a value - we're not sure what it will return
undefined

c) Summarise the main differences : 1 returns a sum, 2 writes to the console
