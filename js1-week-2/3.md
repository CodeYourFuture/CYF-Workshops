Describe the difference between a commit and a push


{YOUR ANSWER HERE}

In the context of version control systems like Git, a commit and a push are two different operations with distinct purposes.

A commit is a snapshot of changes made to a codebase at a specific point in time. 

 es to the remote repository, they are updating the shared codebase with their local changes.

In summary, a commit is a local operation that records changes to a codebase, while a push is a remote operation that sends those local changes to a shared repository where they can be accessed and reviewed by other developers.
