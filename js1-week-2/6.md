## To err is human ( Trickier )


Consider the function `printTimesTable` defined in `6.js`.

This function should behave in the following manner:
when invoked with a number, say 5, it should print the 5 times table, from 1 to 12, on each line:


```
1 * 5 = 5
2 * 5 = 10
3 * 5 = 15
.
.
.
11 * 5 = 55
12 * 5 = 60
```

However, the current implementation isn't working. In fact, it's actually throwing errors ðŸ˜±! 
Try invoking the function in `6.js` and see if you can identify exactly what type of error is occuring and where it originated ( which line of code).

Learning to love your error messages is an absolutely critical skill - best to get used to it early on.
