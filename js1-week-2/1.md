# Predict => Run => Observe => Explain

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctr + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

In this task, you'll need to look at some code in `1.js` and, firstly, predict what it will do, **without executing it**.

{YOUR PREDICTION HERE}

we called an function whiout declaring it first, so runnig the function does nothing.


Afterwards, you can execute the code in `1.js` to check your answer üìù
// IMPORTANT: Please read 1.md first!
// Remember to write your prediction first, before you run this file
