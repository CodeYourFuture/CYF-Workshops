You've started to see **assertions** in your coursework that look something like this:

```js
expect(sum(10,32)).toBe(42);
```

a) Describe, in your own words, what the above assertion checks.

It tests the function sum to check it will pass or not. it gets 2 parameter (10,32) and check of answer is 42 or not. 
Now try the following:

b) Write an **assertion** that checks that a funciton `isMultipleOfTen` returns `true` when called with the input `80`
You can check out the [Jest documentation here](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#matchers) to help you with this task.

expect(isMultipleOfTen(80).toBe(true));
