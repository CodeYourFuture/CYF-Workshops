You've started to see **assertions** in your coursework that look something like this:

```js
expect(sum(10, 32)).toBe(42);
```

a) Describe, in your own words, what the above assertion checks.

The above assertion checks if the function called sum which arguments are 10, 32, will give us result equal to 42.

Now try the following:

b) Write an **assertion** that checks that a funciton `isMultipleOfTen` returns `true` when called with the input `80`
You can check out the [Jest documentation here](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#matchers) to help you with this task.

```js
expect(isMultipleOfTen(80)).toBe(true);
```
