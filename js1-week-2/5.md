You've started to see **assertions** in your coursework that look something like this:

```js
expect(sum(10, 32)).toBe(42);
```

a) Describe, in your own words, what the above assertion checks.
it expects the result from sum(10,32) to be 42.

Now try the following:

b) Write an **assertion** that checks that a funciton `isMultipleOfTen` returns `true` when called with the input `80`
You can check out the [Jest documentation here](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#matchers) to help you with this task.

expect(isMultipleOfTen(80)).toBe(true);
