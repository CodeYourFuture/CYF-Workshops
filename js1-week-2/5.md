You've started to see **assertions** in your coursework that look something like this:

```js
expect(sum(10,32)).toBe(42);
```

a) Describe, in your own words, what the above assertion checks.

The above assertion checks whether the output of the function sum() called with arguments 10 and 32 is equal to 42. 


Now try the following:

b) Write an **assertion** that checks that a funciton `isMultipleOfTen` returns `true` when called with the input `80`
You can check out the [Jest documentation here](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#matchers) to help you with this task.

 
 test('isMultipleOfTen returns true when called with 80', () => {
  
  
  expect(isMultipleOfTen(80)).toBe(true);
});
