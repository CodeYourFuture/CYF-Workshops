## What jobs are available in the tech industry? 

Some of your will become software developers. It's a great path, but there are also other great jobs in the tech industry. So let's work together in understanding the different roles out there.

### Let's do some research 

1.  Make pairs or small groups of 3-4. Research what jobs are available in tech industry. You can also use these [CompTIA Career Pathways](https://www.comptia.org/en/explore-careers/job-roles/?page=1&category=all) or 
[TechCareerExplorer](https://www.careerexplorer.com/careers/?industry=42) as reference. Each group should chose one of these families of roles to research: 
- Engineering roles 
- Low code roles 
- Tech jobs without coding
- IT jobs 

Write 1 role per post it. (10 min)

2. Choose a wall (or, if online, use a Miro board or similar), and walk through each post it. See if you can explain the role - and if you can't, ask if anyone in the group can. (15 min)

3. Pick one role from each group and let's identify more about it: (15 min)
   🎯 Job Title  \
   🧠 What do they actually do all day? \
   💬 Tools or software they use (Google it!) \
   📈 How to get this job: Degree? Certifications? Courses? \
   📋 Skills needed (soft and hard) \
   🔍 Find a real job post and copy 1 key requirement

4. Present the role back to the group.
