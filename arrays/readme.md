## Instructions

This workshop aims to _check your understanding_.

Each task will explain whether or not you should run the code.

For each task, you can use [JS2 week 1 prep](https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/js2/sprints/1/prep/)

You can also use documentation to look up any functions that are unfamiliar.
Don't use ChatGPT or any other AI tool to help you.
