# Introduction to TypeScript

## What is this workshop?

This workshop was written as part of [the SDC curriculum](https://sdc.codeyourfuture.io/) and is suitable as a day plan activity. It is particularly relevant alongside other types and typechecking work.

Check out `DAY_PLAN_WORKSHOP.md` for a guide on how to lead this workshop.

## How to run these exercises locally

Once you have cloned this repository locally, you'll need to install all dependencies for this project. You can do this via your terminal by navigating to your local project's `introduction-to-typescript` directory and then running:

`npm install`

You should then be able to run the tests for each respective exercise by running:

`npm run test-exercise1`
`npm run test-exercise2`
`npm run test-exercise3`

Expect to see red text complaining about errors until you have fixed all of the problems within the relevant exercise files `exercise1.ts`, `exercise2.ts`, `exercise3.ts`.

There are also TypeScript syntax examples available within `src/examples` should you need a hint.

Best of luck!
