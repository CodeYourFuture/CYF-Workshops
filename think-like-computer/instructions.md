# Thinking like a computer

you will need:

- Piece of paper saying "memory" - where we store variables
- Piece of paper saying "console" - where we print to the console
- A set of functions in envelopes

## Rules of execution


### Rule 0 
Only one person can be sat at the table at a time ( where we write to the memory sheet / console sheet)


### Rule 1
Start reading code from top to bottom, one line at a time


### Rule 2
Write and update variables in memory as you go along
For example, if the program says:
```js
let a = 32;
```
You would write down "a : 32" on your piece of paper saying "memory"

### Rule 3

If a function is called that person takes the seat and we jump to the instructions in that function,
using Rules 1 and 2.


### Rule 4
When a function returns or finishes execution this person leaves their seat and everyone jumps forward one seat
