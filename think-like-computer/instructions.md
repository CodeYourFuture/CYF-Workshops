## Thinking like a computer

Each group has:

- a person representing the main program
- a person representing each function (built in and user-defined)
- a piece of paper representing the console
- a piece of paper representing the list of variables (strike out or post-it on each assignment)
- function call/return is a piece of paper passing the arguments/return value
- when a function is called, parameters are added to the variable list, then striked out again (or they could write their variables on a new piece of paper each time the function is called)
