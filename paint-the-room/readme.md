# Paint The Room üßë‚Äçüé®

 Estimating how long a task will take is a part of every job. This is also true in software development but is often difficult due to hidden complexity.

There are some effective techniques that allow us to still estimate tasks and allow us to plan which we will learn through an interactive game.

## Learning Objective

We will be playing a game to learn important techniques to help us estimate our work:
- Relative Estimation, 
- Story Points, 
- Story Elaboration, 
- Story Splitting, 
- Planning Poker, 
- and Backlog Refinement 

## Set up üåº

Split into groups of no more than  5

You will need some paper and something to  write with.

## The game üé≤

Your team have been given the job of painting the room you're in. The customer‚Äôs vague requirement is: ‚ÄúPlease paint the room.‚Äù

Your initial project backlog (work that needs to be done) consists of:

- Paint the north wall
- Paint the south wall
- Paint the east wall
- Paint the west wall
- Paint the ceiling
- Paint the floor

### Part 1: Establish the Anchor Feature

1. Choose one wall in the room that appears to require a medium level of effort compared to the others. 

This wall serves as the anchor for all future relative estimations.

2. Choose a scale, some people use T-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL), some use points (1-5). Whatever the scale that you as a group choose, the anchor wall will be in the middle of your scale. 

"Story Points" are abstract and are used to estimate the effort involved, not time.

### Part 2: Estimate One Wall

1. Planning poker time! Pick Another Wall.Everyone write down your estimate in comparison to your anchor wall. Wait until everyone is ready and reveal your estimates at the same time. 

2. Discuss Estimates:

Focus on the high and low estimates. Ask participants to explain their reasoning.

3. Clarify Assumptions: Do we need masking tape for trim and windows? Should we remove electrical outlet covers? Is the prep work done in advance?
 
 ### Part 3: Backlog Refinement

1. Backlog grooming: What new tasks were discovered upon discussion of the assumptions. Examples:
-  Remove electrical outlet covers
- Apply masking tape around windows
- Purchase supplies
- Cleaning up

2. Story Elaboration: Refine the backlog by adding details about preparation, tools, or other hidden requirements.

3. Refinement: If the task involves more complexity than anticipated, split the story into smaller tasks and provide estimates (e.g., remove fixtures, paint ceiling, reinstall fixtures).

### Part 4: Estimate the Rest 

1. Repeat Parts 2 (Planning Poker) and 3 (Backlog Refinement) for the other walls, floor, and ceiling.

### Part 5: Reflection

Key Takeaways:
The value of Planning Poker is in the <b>conversation</b>. As everyone shares their assumptions, the team gains a better understanding of the scope of work.

Relative estimation helps teams avoid anchoring on time and encourages thinking about effort in comparison to other tasks.

Backlog refinement happens naturally as the team discusses assumptions and new tasks emerge.

Reflection:
Why do you think that software development teams often use this technique for estimating their work?
